## Who are you?
My name is Dakila (Dax) Ledesma, a Biology Ph.D. student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Currently, I engineer and apply computer vision and deep learning techniques to study and analyze plant morphology contained within digitized herbarium sheets on a "big data" scale.

## ...Why create this site?
This was primarily made as an accountability tool, where I put on public display whether I've been productive or not. Secondarily, it serves as a quick reminder tool for the tasks I've completed. Lastly, it archives everything I've done potentially years after I've forgotten about it, which may become useful at some point in time.

I used to do something similar to what this site does manually by updating a Google Slides presentation I shared to my mentors--so making something automatic saves me some time.

## I thought GitHub Pages is static. How does this site work?
Please refer to the [GitHub repository page](https://github.com/dakilaledesma/dakilaledesma.github.io) and the included `README`.
